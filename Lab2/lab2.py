a = 5
b = 2

# 1.  how will i get value 2.5 on division of a/b in 2 ways hint: int to float
# 2.  how will i get 2 on division of a/b
# 3.  how will i get 25 i.e. 5^2 from a and b
# 4.  how will i get decimal value of bits '101'
a = ['aaa']
b = ['bbb', "ccc"]
# 5. after applying what operation on a can i get a list ['aaa', 'aaa', 'aaa']
# 6. after applying what operation on a and b can i get a list ['bbb', 'ccc', 'aaa']
# 7. How can i find length of list a
# 8. how can i get largest (hint max) value from list b i.e. ccc
# 9. how can i get smallest value from list b i.e. bbb
# 10. how can i slice list b so that i get back list ['ccc']
# 11. how can i find get back value 'ccc' using index operation on list provide 2 ways of doing it.. hint -1
# 12. using for loop print as follows from list b
# " this is value bbb"
# " this is value ccc"

a = {
    "naomi": [10, 'female'],
    "john": [15, 'male']
}
# 13. using indexing on dictionary how to print value [10, 'female']
# 14. Using for loop print all values in dictionary a
# 15. using for loop print all key and values in dictionary a


# 16. If i print all keys in dictionary using for loop, will they come in order or not?
