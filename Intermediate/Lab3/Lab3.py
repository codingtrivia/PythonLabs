# Using recursion, print only even numbers in descending order. For e.g. if I say, print_down(10), output would be:
# 10
# 8
# 6
# 4
# 2

# You will need to do a slight modification in the code we wrote for print_up_down in our class today.
# Hint: Use % operator

def print_down(n):
    #<your code here>


print_down(10)
