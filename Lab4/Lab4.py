# Question 1: From below testString variable, I want to print "test string"
testString = "i am test string"

#Question 2
a = set()
a.add("abc")
a.add("def")
b = set()
b.add("def")
b.add("xyz")

# I want to print following from above sets a and b
# def
# xyz
# abc
# abc, xyz


# Question 3: How would you print all key / value pairs of following dictionary
c={"a":[1,2],"b":[3,4],"c":[5,6],"d":[7,8]}

# Question 4: How would you print all values of the dictionary c (c from question 3 above) as follows using %s
# "This is value [1,2]"
# "This is value [3,4]"
# "This is value [5,6]"
# "This is value [7,8]"


# Question 5: How would you print only those values from dictionary c (c from question 3 above) where key is b using if

# Question 6: How would you print all keys that have even values from dictionary d below. Hint: using if and %
d={"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4}
